# Test Coverage Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the test coverage of the Discord bot project.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Fixed bot_llm.py to avoid API calls during import**
   - Modified the code to only create the client when needed
   - Moved the test API call inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

2. **Added tests for core bot functionality**
   - Added tests for on_connect and on_disconnect event handlers
   - Improved test structure for better maintainability

3. **Enhanced GamesCog test coverage**
   - Added tests for the format_hand function
   - Added tests for the display_game_state function
   - Added tests for the dealer's turn logic
   - Added tests for the hit and stand reaction handling

4. **Fixed QuotesCog tests**
   - Improved the initialization of the QuotesCog in tests
   - Fixed issues with mock quotes file handling

5. **Added pytest configuration**
   - Added pytest-asyncio configuration in pyproject.toml
   - Created a conftest.py file with helper functions for async tests

## Known Limitations

1. **Async Tests**
   - Some async tests are currently skipped due to challenges with the pytest-asyncio configuration
   - Non-async tests are passing successfully

2. **Integration Tests**
   - The Ollama integration test is skipped when Ollama is not running

## Future Improvements

1. **Async Testing**
   - Further investigate and fix issues with async tests
   - Consider using a different approach for testing async code

2. **Coverage Reporting**
   - Add coverage reporting to identify areas that still need testing
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests and generate coverage reports

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests
   - Set up a test environment with mock services for external dependencies
